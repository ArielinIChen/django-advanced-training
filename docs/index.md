# Welcome to Advanced Django Training

This training is intended for developers who are already somewhat familiar with Python and Django. If you are not familiar with these make sure to complete the [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/) tutorials before using this training material.

[Python](https://python.org) is a general-purpose programming language. [Django](https://djangoproject.com) is a powerful web development framework built on top of Python.

This training is intended to help Django developers learn a little more deeply about some of the features Django has to offer. The format should allow you to get the information you are wanting to learn about a feature quickly. There is also a basic Django project that you can [clone and get setup](training-reference/project-setup.md) to have a place to play around with the concepts and ideas that are taught here.

After you have setup the training project, or if you have decided not to, you can jump to one of the features below to start learning more about that feature of Django.

If you would like to contribute to this training material, see the [Contributing](training-reference/contributing.md) page.
